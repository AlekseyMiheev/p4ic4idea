# To Do List

Many of the to-dos are listed in the bug list on Github.

With 2017.1, many things put into the plugin are using old systems, or aren't doing things the right
way anymore.


## idea-cache module

This module isn't needed.  The only thing here worth keeping is the ignore stuff.


## How to implement .p4file like support?

Currently, the choice was made to eliminate the idea of `.p4file` support.  However, it
is still incredibly useful for users with joined projects.  This is on the low-priority
list, but how would it work?


## Extended API

A few classes (*which ones? enumerate them here*) use APIs that were extended or changed from
one version to the next.  These need to be pushed into the compat APIs.


## More...

There's always more.
