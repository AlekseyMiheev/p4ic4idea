/**
 * General IO stream manipulation utilities.
 * <p>
 * This class provides static utility methods for input/output operations.
 * <ul>
 * <li>closeQuietly - these methods close a stream ignoring nulls and exceptions
 * <li>toXxx/read - these methods read data from a stream
 * <li>write - these methods write data to a stream
 * <li>copy - these methods copy all the data from one stream to another
 * <li>contentEquals - these methods compare the content of two streams
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The byte-to-char methods and char-to-byte methods involve a conversion step.
 * Two methods are provided in each case, one that uses the platform default
 * encoding and the other which allows you to specify an encoding. You are
 * encouraged to always specify an encoding because relying on the platform
 * default can lead to unexpected results, for example when moving from
 * development to production.
 * <p>
 * All the methods in this class that read a stream are buffered internally.
 * This means that there is no cause to use a <code>BufferedInputStream</code>
 * or <code>BufferedReader</code>. The default buffer size of 4K has been shown
 * to be efficient in tests.
 * <p>
 * The various copy methods all delegate the actual copying to one of the following methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #copyLarge(InputStream, OutputStream, byte[])}</li>
 * <li>{@link #copyLarge(InputStream, OutputStream, long, long, byte[])}</li>
 * <li>{@link #copyLarge(Reader, Writer, char[])}</li>
 * <li>{@link #copyLarge(Reader, Writer, long, long, char[])}</li>
 * </ul>
 * For example, {@link #copy(InputStream, OutputStream)} calls {@link #copyLarge(InputStream, OutputStream)}
 * which calls {@link #copy(InputStream, OutputStream, int)} which creates the buffer and calls
 * {@link #copyLarge(InputStream, OutputStream, byte[])}.
 * <p>
 * Applications can re-use buffers by using the underlying methods directly.
 * This may improve performance for applications that need to do a lot of copying.
 * <p>
 * Wherever possible, the methods in this class do <em>not</em> flush or close
 * the stream. This is to avoid making non-portable assumptions about the
 * streams' origin and further use. Thus the caller is still responsible for
 * closing streams after use.
 * <p>
 * Origin of code: Excalibur.
