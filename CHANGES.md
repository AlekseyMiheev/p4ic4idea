### Details

* Major refactoring to the management of changelists.
    * Perforce Changelists are now cached application-wide.
      This allows for code clean-up that should hopefully make
      some of the file migration between changelists
      less common (#22).
* Bug fixes.
    * non-numeric perforce server port (#23)
    * Background threads were causing refresh problems.  Turned them
      off to limit the number of issues they caused.
