# IDEA Community VCS Integration for Perforce




## ::v0.4.2::

### Overview

* Bug fix for localhost port.
* Enabled submit.

### Details

* Submit enabled.  Very early version of submit is now possible.  It does not allow for
  setting job status or adding jobs to the submitted changelist.  It has the issue like
  much of the rest of the code where the changelist view isn't updated correctly.
* Bug fix for localhost port.
    * A `P4PORT=1666` format would fail parsing, because the P4 Java API only supports
      `hostname:port` or `schema://hostname:port` formats.  As a fix,
      `localhost` is prefixed for any P4PORT setting that does not have a colon in
      the actual port part.

* Bug fixes.

### Details

* Major refactoring to the management of changelists.
    * Perforce Changelists are now cached application-wide.
      This allows for code clean-up that should hopefully make
      some of the file migration between changelists
      less common (#22).
* Bug fixes.
    * non-numeric perforce server port (#23)
    * Background threads were causing refresh problems.  Turned them
      off to limit the number of issues they caused.
* Add support for IDEA 141.2.2
