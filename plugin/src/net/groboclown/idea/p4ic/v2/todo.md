# All the remaining tasks for the v2 migration:


## Critical and Blocker Bugs

These bugs need to be handled before features.

1. `ChangeListSync` needs to be thoroughly debugged.


## Features that drive architecture

There are some features that drive how the inner architecture will work.

1. History, as this will dictate the necessary stored information for
   cached files and revision numbers.


## Features Needing Migration

1. `P4ChangelistListener`


## Not-implemented behavior in existing features

(see `// FIXME implement` comments)
