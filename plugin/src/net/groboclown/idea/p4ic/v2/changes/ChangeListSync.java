//        reports data to ChangelistBuilder using the following methods:
//
//    processChange() is called for files which have been checked out (or modified if the VCS doesn't use an explicit checkout model), scheduled for addition or deletion, moved or renamed.
//    processUnversionedFile() is called for files which exist on disk, but are not managed by the VCS, not scheduled for addition, and not ignored through .cvsignore or a similar mechanism.
//    processLocallyDeletedFile() is called for files which exist in the VCS repository, but do not exist on disk and are not scheduled for deletion.
//    processModifiedWithoutCheckout() is used only with VCSes which use an explicit checkout model. It is called for files which are writable on disk but not checked out through the VCS.
//    processIgnoredFile() is called for files which are not managed by the VCS but are ignored through .cvsignore or a similar mechanism.
//    processSwitchedFile() is called for files or directories for which the working copy corresponds to a different branch compared to the working copy of their parent directory. This can be called for the same files for which processSwitchedFile() has already been called.
